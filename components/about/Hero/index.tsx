                        I started off design after finishing Desktop Publishing training where I was fascinated with being able to import fine elements from programs like Instant Artist into CorelDraw 9 and creating color images with it, that is where my design journey began as went ahead and I learnt Graphics Design professionally.

                        The idea that I can help people make better decisions, help businesses scale and make money, better peopleâ€™s day to day lives through design is what drove me to Product Design as I found that it would put me at the forefront of solving problems with design.
                        I am a self-taught designer with an extra eye for users, consumers and product owners alike.
